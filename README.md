# LAB | CNN Daily Mail Data Cleaning

## Learning Goals

This lab will help you:

- Understand and apply regular expressions (regex) to textual data
- Perform pattern matching and data extraction on natural language text
- Work hands-on with NLP use cases such as tokenization, cleaning, and identifying patterns in text
- Practice manipulating real-world text data in Python using regex

## Requirements

- Download the dataset from Kaggle: [**Human-Written Text - CNN_DailyMail**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/youssefelebiary/human-written-text)


## Getting Started

### Step 1: Load the Dataset

- Load the dataset `CNN_DailyMail.csv` file & examine the structure of the text data fields.

### Step 2: Regex Practice Tasks

Complete the following regex exercises on the text data:

1. **Extract all email addresses** present in the text.
2. **Find and list all URLs** embedded in the dataset.
3. **Identify all phone numbers** using regex patterns typical to various country formats.
4. **Clean the text** by removing special characters, punctuation, and extra spaces.
5. **Extract dates and times** mentioned in the text (e.g., “January 5, 2023” or “5:00 PM”).
6. **Count the occurrences of specific keywords or patterns**, such as “AI”, “machine learning”, or hashtags.
7. **Split the text into sentences** or words using regex delimiters.

*Tip:* Use Python’s `re` library and list comprehensions to efficiently process text data.
